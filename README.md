# IPTWtrim: Performance Analysis on Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) Trimming for Causal Inference

The IPTWtrim package provides functions for conducting causal inference with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and weight trimming. It allows you to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) using weight trimming based on simulation studies, and investigates the bias, empirical standard error (EmpSE), and the mean squared error (MSE) for 
the estimated ATE. 

See vignette for more details on function usage.
